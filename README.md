# FreshFood Tracker

FreshFood Tracker is a smart and simple fridge management system developed as part of the CS214 â€“ Data Structures course.

## Overview

This system helps users manage their fridge contents, reduce food waste, and get recipe suggestions based on available ingredients. It applies fundamental data structures to organize and process data efficiently.

## Objectives

- Prevent food waste by tracking expiration dates.
- Organize fridge contents for better visibility.
- Suggest simple recipes using current ingredients.
- Provide a user-friendly menu interface.

## Key Concepts

This project demonstrates the practical use of core data structures:

- Queue: to manage items in the order they were added.
- Stack: to handle items with last-in-first-out logic.
- Array: for storing and accessing fridge data.

## Features

- Add new food items to the fridge.
- Automatically detect and list expired items.
- Recommend recipes based on fridge contents.
- View all current or expired items.

## Technologies

- Programming Language: C++
- Data Structures: Queue, Stack, Array
